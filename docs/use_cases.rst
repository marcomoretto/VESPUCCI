1. In this first excercise we will perform few basic operations with VESPUCCI. We will create a Module starting from few genes and then automatically extend it by adding more genes. We will also have a look at gene and samples annotations. `The use case Notebook is hosted in Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/github/marcomoretto/VESPUCCI/blob/master/VESPUCCI_with_pyCOMPASS_use_case_1.ipynb>`_
 
2. The second exercise tries to show a more general data analysis pipeline that relies on VESPUCCI for the data but integrates other tools and an packages, such as `Scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`__, used to fit a Gaussian Mixture Model and `GOAtools <https://github.com/tanghaibao/goatools>`_ used for the Gene Ontology Enrichment. Everything is seamlessly integrated in one analysis workflow that ca be explored in `this Notebook hosted in Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/github/marcomoretto/VESPUCCI/blob/master/VESPUCCI_with_pyCOMPASS_use_case_2.ipynb>`_.
 
3. In this use case, we have queried the database with a short list of genes putatively involved in pollen development with the final goal of retrieving additional genes with the same function. `This Notebook hosted in Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/github/marcomoretto/VESPUCCI/blob/master/VESPUCCI_with_pyCOMPASS_use_case_3.ipynb>`_.
 
4. In this use case the main aim is the characterization of a grapevine gene family. Specific objetives are to verify if the different gene members have a tissue-specific expression and to identify the members those expression is significantly modulated upon biotic stresses. `This Notebook hosted in Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/github/marcomoretto/VESPUCCI/blob/master/VESPUCCI_with_pyCOMPASS_use_case_4.ipynb>`_.
 
5. In this final exercise we start from few thousand of genes related to a Myb transcription factor and try to determine which are tissue-specific. After the initial filtering we attached the result with a GO enrichment analysis using `GOAtools <https://github.com/tanghaibao/goatools>`_. `This Notebook hosted in Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/github/marcomoretto/VESPUCCI/blob/master/VESPUCCI_with_pyCOMPASS_use_case_5.ipynb>`_.
