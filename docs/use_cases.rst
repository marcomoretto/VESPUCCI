Use Cases
=========

 1. In this first excercise we will perform few basic operations with VESPUCCI. We will create a Module starting from few genes and then automatically extend it by adding more genes. We will also have a look at gene and samples annotations. `The use case Notebook is hosted in Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xx4lVvYPBfXkM6Cq95suyikHhmQJ7atV?authuser=2#scrollTo=WTcil1UqkSYo>`_
