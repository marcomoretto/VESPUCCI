 1. In this first excercise we will perform few basic operations with VESPUCCI. We will create a Module starting from few genes and then automatically extend it by adding more genes. We will also have a look at gene and samples annotations. `The use case Notebook is hosted in Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xx4lVvYPBfXkM6Cq95suyikHhmQJ7atV>`_
 
 2. The second exercise tries to show a more general data analysis pipeline that relies on VESPUCCI for the data but integrates other tools and an packages, such as `Scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`__, used to fit a Gaussian Mixture Model and `GOAtools <https://github.com/tanghaibao/goatools>`_ used for the Gene Ontology Enrichment. Everything is seamlessly integrated in one analysis workflow that ca be explored in `this Notebook hosted in Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lm9fyWcudiKZac91gR6i2B2NbtfFRMDy>`_.
 
 3. In this use case, we have queried the database with a short list of genes putatively involved in pollen development with the final goal of retrieving additional genes with the same function. `This Notebook hosted in Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FtXmhzYeBL2-mF4-RpAM3efr3_YRPLei?usp=sharing>`_.
 
 4. In this use case the main aim is the characterization of a grapevine gene family. Specific objetives are to verify if the different gene members have a tissue-specific expression and to identify the members those expression is significantly modulated upon biotic stresses. `This Notebook hosted in Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/185SDG1pQL5tBcYlwDYz5Q79gmRmOIhx2?usp=sharing>`_.
 
 5. In this final exercise we start from few thousand of genes related to a Myb transcription factor and try to determine which are tissue-specific. After the initial filtering we attached the result with a GO enrichment analysis using `GOAtools <https://github.com/tanghaibao/goatools>`_. `This Notebook hosted in Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y7du48GzYBgxZVXHrPwOZlMpe7U2nOj-?usp=sharing>`_.
