Use Cases
=========

 1. In this first excercise we will perform few basic operations with VESPUCCI. We will create a Module starting from few genes and then automatically extend it by adding more genes. We will also have a look at gene and samples annotations. `The use case Notebook is hosted in Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xx4lVvYPBfXkM6Cq95suyikHhmQJ7atV?authuser=2#scrollTo=WTcil1UqkSYo>`_
 
 2. The second exercise tries to show a more general data analysis pipeline that relies on VESPUCCI for the data but integrates other tools and an packages, such as _`Scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_, used to fit a Gaussian Mixture Model and _`GOAtools <https://github.com/tanghaibao/goatools>`_ used for the Gene Ontology Enrichment. Everything is seamlessly integrated in one analysis workflow that ca be explored in `this Notebook hosted in Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lm9fyWcudiKZac91gR6i2B2NbtfFRMDy?authuser=2#scrollTo=PacR66jIhGLA>`_.
